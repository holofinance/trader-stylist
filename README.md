## Why

Why was this extension developed?

* **No security risks** by requiring access only relevant trading websites.
  * Almost all other extensions that allow you to change the CSS and Javascript of your websites, require access to the data on all your websites. This opens security risks.
* **Open Source** - everyone can check the code, install locally the extension, contribute and comment
* **For traders** - made only for the most often used trading websites used by traders.
